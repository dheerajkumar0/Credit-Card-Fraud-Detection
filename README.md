# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression
#Overview

This project aims to build a credit card fraud detection system using Logistic Regression. The primary objective is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions.

#Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant issue that affects both financial institutions and cardholders. Early detection of fraudulent transactions can prevent substantial financial losses. This project leverages Logistic Regression, a statistical method for binary classification, to predict fraudulent transactions.

#Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

Number of transactions: 284,807
Number of fraudulent transactions: 492

#Model

The model used in this project is Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression is a linear model for binary classification that predicts the probability of a binary outcome.
